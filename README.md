# CODSOFT Data Science Internship ðŸš€

This repository contains the projects completed during my **CODSOFT Data Science Internship**.  
Each task explores different domains of machine learning â€“ classification, multiclass classification, and imbalanced data handling.

## ðŸ“‚ Tasks

### ðŸ”¹ Task 1 â€“ Titanic Survival Prediction ðŸš¢
**Problem:** Predict survival of Titanic passengers based on features like age, sex, class, fare, etc.  
**Approach:**  
- Data preprocessing (missing values for Age, Embarked, Cabin)  
- Feature engineering: FamilySize, IsAlone, Title  
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest  
**Results:**  
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: ~81%  
- Random Forest Accuracy: ~84%  
- ROC-AUC: ~0.88  
**Insights:** Female passengers & 1st class travelers had higher survival chances.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 2 â€“ Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸
**Problem:** Classify iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica using sepal & petal measurements.  
**Approach:**  
- Encoded species labels, standardized features  
- Models: SVM (RBF kernel), KNN (k=7)  
**Results:**  
- SVM Accuracy: ~97%  
- KNN Accuracy: ~95%  
**Insights:** Setosa perfectly separable; Versicolor & Virginica overlap â†’ misclassifications occur there.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 3 â€“ Credit Card Fraud Detection ðŸ’³
**Problem:** Detect fraudulent transactions from highly imbalanced credit card dataset.  
**Approach:**  
- Stratified split to preserve class imbalance  
- Models: Logistic Regression (class_weight=balanced), Random Forest (balanced_subsample)  
- Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  
**Results:**  
- Logistic Regression ROC-AUC: ~0.94  
- Random Forest ROC-AUC: ~0.98  
**Insights:** Accuracy is misleading for imbalanced data; Recall is critical; Random Forest performed best.
